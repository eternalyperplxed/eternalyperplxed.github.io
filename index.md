title: Welcome to Security Duct Tape!
---
Security Duct Tape is intended to be a place where I write about the world of information/cyber security, both at a technical guidance level as well as at a "philosophical" level. Most things will have opinions and biases baked in, but I'll try to acknowledge them as best I can. Most likely you'll also find some stuff about home automation and other projects. If you want to know more, feel free to reach out.
