title: Code of Conduct
---

Let's clear the air, in the event that this thing becomes an interactive thing, there are some basic rules and things that need to be understood.

The rule of thumb is "Don't be a jerk." To elaborate, here is a non-exhaustive list of things that will not be allowed:
- Intolerance (Given the inherent [paradox of intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance), let's expand)
- Racism
- Nazis
- Bigotry
- Sexism and/or misogyny
- Transphobia/Anti-transgender rhetoric
- Homophobia/Anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric
- Fascism
- Any statements supporting the exceptionalism of a person or people based on their race, gender, sexual identity, or nationality.
- Doxxing
- Solicitation or advertising of illegal goods and/or services
- Anything that can be construed as, or implied to be, support for something that harms children.

Overall, this space is to talk about the issues, events, and tools related to information and cybersecurity technologies and their associated industries. We can disagree, have tough and opinionated conversations, and probably still disagree in the end. All I'm asking for is that we stay on topic.
